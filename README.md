## Personal Experience and Self-Competence

I have already **perceived it sensually, sensorily, or in some other way**, and have **grasped it myself**.  
This means I **possess my own inner reference**, allowing me to draw on it without external guidance.  

I **can do it myself** — from experience, from perception, from lived knowledge.  
This self-competence is rooted in my **conscious experience** and **embodied memory**.
